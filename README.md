Qubit Control System (QubiC) [1]

QubiC is an in-house developed FPGA based qubit control system developed at LBNL under the supporting from Department of Energy (DOE).
The QubiC source code is released under a LBNL modified BSD license.

The QubiC contains the hardware, FPGA gateware and software. Each in its own git submodule. 
So the easist way is clone the repo recursively 

`git clone --recursive https://gitlab.com/LBL-QubiC/qubic.git`

or 

`git clone --recursive git@gitlab.com:LBL-QubiC/qubic.git`

You may also directly the submodules only.
